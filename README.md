# Artificial-intelligence-word-embedding-by-creating-your-own-short-sentences.-
In this assignment, you will exercise word embedding by creating your own short sentences. More specifically,

1.Create    **EXACTLY**20 sentences. The maximum length of each sentence is FIVE (5). Two sample sentences may look like: “Excellent work”, “Good students work very hard”.2.Create word embeddings for the vocabulary (i.e. unique words  ) in your sentences. You can choose one OR more word embedding methods from the embedding layer approach, the CBOW approach, the Skip-Gram approach, or the GloVe approach.Create a WORD document to answer the following questions for EACH of the word embedding method you choose: 1.Describe your embedding approach, architecture, and all the    parameters (i.e. epochs, batches) you used. 2.Describe the dimensionality of your word vectors.  3.List the vocabulary in your training set. 4.Use   the   t-SNE method to reduce your word vectors to 2-dimension and p  lot the 2-D points in a figure   . Each point (vector) in the figure MUST be labeled with the original words in your vocabulary. (NOTE: you may need to adjust your training sentences so words with certain meaning cluster closer together in your t-SNE figure)    5.List the training time to train your word embedding model.
